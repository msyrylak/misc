C++ Minimal Instruction Set Computer Simulator (MISC)

Inspired by MOS 6502 and other retro CPUs, with memory editor highlighting byte or bytes that are currently in use. It simulates an 8-bit processor capable of addressing 64KB of memory  three main registers (R1, R2, R3) and also a Status Register (SR), Program Counter (PC) and a Stack Pointer (SP) with a descending stack default value of 0xFD (253). The Instruction Set can fit up to 256 instructions, each of which consist of an addressing mode, the register itâ€™s working on and the operation to perform - all potentially combined in different configurations.
